# MaxBook

## What 

Personal homepage where I start with tracking my projects.

## Why

1. More success in finishing my projects. If I write something down the probabilies are higher to stick them (personal experience and Cal Newport).

2. Online reference. The personal book site is my personal digital garden and I can make all kinds of things public.

## Dependencies

`pip3 install GitPython`

`pip3 install Markdown`
